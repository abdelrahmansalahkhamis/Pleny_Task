#  PlenyTask

## Features

* This project is fully coded in SwiftUI

* The code supports mostly 16+

* No third party liberaries are included, Instead of that every thing implemented using pure swift

* I have implemented the MVVM pattern as an architectural patten

* I have implemented a generic network layer using URLSession that can be implemented using any data type

* I have the NetworkManager that is used for both network layer and unit testing

* for the project herarichy, there are several groups of files that manages the entire code

* some import notes regarding the implemented equations:-

** for pagination in posts screen, I've configured paging to retreive 10 posts per page
** for search, in order to call api the search word must contains at least 3 letters which will make search api not get called to much time
